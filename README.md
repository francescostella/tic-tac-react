# Tic Tac React

Tic Tac React is my customized version of [React Official Tutorial of TicTacToe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) that I extended with: 
- game mode: choose between "Human VS Human" and "Human VS Bot"
- AI Player: an Artificial Intelligence player to play against
- AI Player levels: 'easy' (you can win the AI) and 'insane' (in practice: you can't never win against the AI, because the AI will never make a mistake)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
